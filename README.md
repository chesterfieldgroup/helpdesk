# IT Support Hub

## Overview

The IT Support Hub is a streamlined web portal designed to facilitate efficient communication between the H.W. Kaufman Group IT support team and its users. This portal allows users to submit IT support queries through an embedded form, ensuring that help is just a few clicks away.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Built with Bootstrap, ensuring the website is responsive and accessible across all devices.
- **Simple Navigation:** Features a user-friendly navigation bar that guides users through the website.
- **Embedded IT Support Form:** Incorporates an embedded Microsoft Forms for IT support queries, allowing for easy submission of issues and requests.
- **Company Branding:** Showcases the logos of H.W. Kaufman Group and its subsidiaries, reinforcing brand identity.

## TODO

- **Node.js:** Create a backend so that the form can push data to the json database. Ensure it is built to be secure and isn't vulnerable to CSRF, XSS, and file upload vulnerabilities.
- **Azure Oauth:** Need to ensure that only users signed in with mircosoft accounts tied to @chesterfieldgroup can submit a form request, and so that only Sean and Jack can only access admin.
- **Screenshots:** Add functionality so that users can use snip and cut to paste images into the form which can be viewed via the admin table.
